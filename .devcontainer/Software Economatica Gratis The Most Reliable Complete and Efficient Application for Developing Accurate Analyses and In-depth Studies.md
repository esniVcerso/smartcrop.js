ArcView 3.2 is a geographic information system (GIS) software that was developed by Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) in the late 1990s. It was one of the most popular and widely used GIS software at that time, offering features such as data visualization, analysis, editing, and geoprocessing. ArcView 3.2 was designed to run on Windows operating systems, such as Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, and XP.
 
However, ArcView 3.2 is no longer supported by ESRI, and it is not compatible with newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 7, 8, or 10. Moreover, ArcView 3.2 is a 32-bit application that cannot run on 64-bit systems without some modifications. Therefore, many users who still want to use ArcView 3.2 on modern computers face some challenges and difficulties.
