In this article, we will highlight some of the key features and benefits of Autodesk 3ds Max 2020.1 update for Windows 64-bit systems.
 
## Chamfer Modifier Improvements
 
The Chamfer modifier has been redesigned to provide more control and flexibility over the chamfering process. You can now create complex and realistic chamfers with different profiles, such as linear, radial, or custom curves. You can also adjust the tension and bias of the chamfer curve, as well as apply different materials and mapping coordinates to each chamfer segment. The Chamfer modifier also supports quad intersections, which can help you create cleaner topology and avoid pinching artifacts.
 
## Weighted Normals Modifier
 
The Weighted Normals modifier is a new tool that allows you to calculate and assign custom normals to your mesh based on the area, angle, or crease weight of each face. This can help you improve the shading quality and reduce the need for additional geometry or smoothing groups. The Weighted Normals modifier also supports hard edges, which can be defined by edge selection or smoothing groups.

## Arnold Renderer Enhancements
 
Arnold is a high-quality and efficient renderer that is integrated with Autodesk 3ds Max. Autodesk 3ds Max 2020.1 update brings several enhancements to the Arnold renderer, such as:
 
- New Physical Material: The Physical Material is a new shader that is compatible with Arnold and other renderers that support the Autodesk Standard Surface. It offers a simplified interface with intuitive parameters for creating realistic materials.
- New Physical Sky: The Physical Sky is a new environment shader that simulates the natural sky based on the sun position, date, time, and location. It also supports atmospheric effects such as haze, fog, and clouds.
- New OSL Shaders: OSL (Open Shading Language) is a scripting language that allows you to create custom shaders for Arnold. Autodesk 3ds Max 2020.1 update includes several new OSL shaders, such as noise patterns, color correction, math operations, and more.
- New AOVs: AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) are render passes that allow you to output different aspects of your scene for compositing purposes. Autodesk 3ds Max 2020.1 update adds several new AOVs for Arnold, such as diffuse direct, specular direct, transmission direct, subsurface direct, coat direct, emission direct, diffuse indirect, specular indirect, transmission indirect, subsurface indirect, coat indirect, emission indirect, albedo, normal camera, depth.

## Other Improvements
 
Autodesk 3ds Max 2020.1 update also includes other improvements and bug fixes for various aspects of the software, such as:

- Viewport performance: The viewport performance has been improved for scenes with high-poly meshes, large textures, or complex shaders.
- Scene Converter: The Scene Converter is a tool that allows you to convert your scenes from one renderer to another or to a standard format. It now supports converting scenes from V-Ray Next to Arnold or Physical Material.
- Bake to Texture: The Bake to Texture tool allows you to bake lighting and shading information into texture maps for your models. It now supports baking multiple objects at once and exporting them as a single file.
- Fluids: The Fluids feature allows you to create realistic fluid simulations using Phoenix FD or Bifrost. It now supports caching fluids in Alembic format and importing them as point clouds or meshes.
- Scripting: The scripting capabilities of Autodesk 3ds Max have been enhanced with 8cf37b1e13
