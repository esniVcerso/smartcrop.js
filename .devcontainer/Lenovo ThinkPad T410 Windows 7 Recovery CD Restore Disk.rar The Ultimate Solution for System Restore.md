Second, it is more reliable, as USB keys are less prone to scratches and damage than optical discs. Third, it is more eco-friendly, as you can reuse the same USB key for multiple purposes and avoid creating electronic waste.

Creating and using the USB recovery key may take different amounts of time depending on your internet speed, USB key size, and laptop model. Generally, downloading the recovery files may take from 30 minutes to several hours, while creating the USB recovery key may take from 10 to 30 minutes. Installing Windows 7 using the USB recovery key may take from 20 to 60 minutes. Therefore, you should plan ahead and make sure you have enough time and battery power to complete the process.
 
This method of restoring Windows 7 using a USB recovery key can be used for other Lenovo models that support the DDRS service. You can check the list of compatible models on [this page](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht103653-lenovo-digital-download-recovery-service-ddrs-download-the-files-needed-to-create-a-lenovo-usb-recovery-key). However, you should not use the same USB recovery key for different models, as it may cause compatibility issues. You should create a separate USB recovery key for each model using the Lenovo Recovery Media Creator tool.
