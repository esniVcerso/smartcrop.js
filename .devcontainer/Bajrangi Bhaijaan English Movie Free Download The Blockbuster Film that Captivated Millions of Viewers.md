Another scene that touched the viewers was when Bajrangi and Munni cross the border into Pakistan with the help of a group of devotees who were singing "Bhar Do Jholi Meri", a traditional qawwali song.

The song expresses the longing and devotion of the singer to God, and also symbolizes the bond between Bajrangi and Munni.
 
The film ends with a tear-jerking climax, where Bajrangi is arrested by the Pakistani authorities for illegally entering the country. He is taken to the Wagah border, where he is about to be handed over to the Indian officials. However, Munni runs towards him and calls him "Mama", revealing that she can speak. She also recognizes her mother in the crowd and reunites with her family. Bajrangi is hailed as a hero by both the Indians and the Pakistanis, who chant his name and salute him.
