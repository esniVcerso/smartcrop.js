## Step 1: Find Your Lock's Serial Number
 
The first step to finding your Master Lock combination using serial number is to locate your lock's serial number. The serial number is usually stamped on the back of the lock body or on the bottom of the lock case. It consists of a letter followed by six numbers, for example, A123456.
 
If you cannot find your serial number on your lock, you can also check the original packaging or the instruction sheet that came with your lock. If you still cannot find it, you might have to contact Master Lock customer service for assistance.
  
## Step 2: Fill Out and Notarize the Lost Combination Form
 
The next step is to fill out the Lost Combination Form (PDF) that you can download from Master Lock's website. You will need to provide your name, address, phone number, email address, lock model number, and serial number. You will also need to sign and date the form.
 
However, filling out the form is not enough. You also need to have it notarized by a Notary Public to prove that you are the owner of the lock. A Notary Public is a person who is authorized to witness and verify signatures on legal documents. You can find a Notary Public at banks, post offices, libraries, or online services.
