In this article, we will show you how to hack MUGEN Tournament and access the secret content that will make your game more fun and diverse. You will need a few tools and some basic knowledge of editing files, but don't worry, we will guide you step by step.
 
Before we start, make sure you have a backup of your original MUGEN Tournament folder, in case something goes wrong or you want to restore the game to its original state. Also, make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as the hacked version will take up more than 10 GB.
 
## Step 1: Download the Hack
 
The first thing you need to do is download the hack that contains the 800 characters and 400 stages. You can find it on this link: [https://example.com/mugen-hack.zip](https://example.com/mugen-hack.zip). The file size is about 9 GB, so it might take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Extract the Hack
 
Once you have downloaded the hack, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called "MUGEN (800 Characters; 400 Stages) Tournament Hack". Open it and copy all the files inside it.
 
## Step 3: Paste the Hack
 
Now you need to paste the files you copied into your MUGEN Tournament folder. This is usually located in C:\Program Files\MUGEN Tournament or C:\Program Files (x86)\MUGEN Tournament. If you are asked to overwrite any existing files, click yes.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the Hack
 
Congratulations! You have successfully hacked MUGEN Tournament and unlocked 800 characters and 400 stages. To play the game, just run the MUGEN.exe file in your MUGEN Tournament folder. You can select any character and stage from the menu, or use the random option for more variety. Have fun!
  
## Step 5: Customize the Hack
 
If you want to further customize your MUGEN experience, you can edit the files in the data folder of your MUGEN Tournament folder. For example, you can change the screen resolution, the number of rounds, the life bars, the music, and more. You can also add or remove characters and stages by editing the select.def file. However, be careful not to delete or modify any essential files, as this might cause the game to crash or malfunction.
 
## Step 6: Share the Hack
 
If you enjoyed the hack and want to share it with your friends or other MUGEN fans, you can do so by uploading it to a file-sharing site like Mega or Google Drive. However, make sure you give credit to the original creators of the characters and stages, as well as the hack itself. You can find their names and websites in the readme.txt file in your MUGEN Tournament folder. Also, do not claim the hack as your own or sell it for money, as this is illegal and disrespectful.
